# Differentiating ChatGPT from Humans: Detecting ChatGPT-Generated Text and Human Text Using Machine Learning - Arabic langwage

Recently, the identification of human text and ChatGPT-generated text has become a hot research topic. The current study presents a Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTMRNN) model to detect both human as well as ChatGPT-generated text. The purpose of the proposed LSTMRNN method is to investigate the model’s decision and detect the presence of any particular pattern. In addition to this, the LSTMRNN technique focuses on designing Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), word embedding, and count vectorizers for the feature extraction process. For the detection and classification processes, the LSTMRNN model is used. The simulation performance of the proposed LSTMRNN technique was investigated on benchmark databases, and the outcome demonstrated the advantage of the LSTMRNN system over other recent methods (SVM, Basic Deep learning, Convolution Model (CNN) LSTM Model (RNN)).
1.	Data set has 10,000 records. [5,000 records are taken from ChatGPT generated Arabic Dataset CIDAR  and other 5000 records taken from human written articles MNAD (Moroccan News Articles) Dataset  and are merged]
2.	LSTMRNN based model developed and trained using 9900 randomly selected records and other 100 records for validating from above dataset.  Results and metrics are captured and presented. 
3.	Comparative outcomes of the LSTMRNN approach with other techniques on the same datasets (using 9900 randomly selected records for training and other 100 records for validating). Comparing table and graph given.
•	SVM
•	Basic Deep learning
•	Convolution Model(CNN)
•	LSTM Model  (RNN)
