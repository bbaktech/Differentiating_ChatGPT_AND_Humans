Differentiating ChatGPT from Humans: Detecting ChatGPT-Generated Text and Human Text Using Machine Learning - Arabic langwage

1.	Data set has 10,000 records. [5,000 records are taken from ChatGPT generated Arabic Dataset CIDAR  and other 5000 records taken from human written articles MNAD (Moroccan News Articles) Dataset  and are merged]

2.	LSTMRNN based model developed and trained using 9900 randomly selected records and other 100 records for validating from above dataset.  Results and metrics are captured and presented. 

3.	Comparative outcomes of the LSTMRNN approach with other techniques on the same datasets (using 9900 randomly selected records for training and other 100 records for validating). Comparing table and graph given.
•	SVM
•	Basic Deep learning
•	Convolution Model(CNN)
•	LSTM Model  (RNN)
